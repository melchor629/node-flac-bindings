## How it works

The module will be divided in various sections:

- [StreamEncoder](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/blob/dev/lib/encoder.d.ts) - a `stream.Transform` class for encoding raw PCM streams
- [FileEncoder](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/blob/dev/lib/encoder.d.ts) - a `stream.Writable` class for encoding raw PCM streams into a file
- [StreamDecoder](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/blob/dev/lib/decoder.d.ts) - a `stream.Transform` class for decoding FLAC into a PCM stream
- [FileDecoder](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/blob/dev/lib/decoder.d.ts) - a `stream.Readable` class for decoding FLAC file into a PCM stream
- `api` - the native bindings
    - [format](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__format.html) - includes only the functions and some types
    - [Encoder](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__encoder.html) - the `StreamEncoder` API
    - [Decoder](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__decoder.html) - the `StreamDecoder` API
    - [metadata](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__object.html) - includes the `StreamMetadata` classes and their methods
    - [metadata0](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level0.html) - metadata level 0 APIs
    - [SimpleIterator](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level1.html) - metadata level 1 iterator class
    - [Chain](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level2.html) - metadata level 2 Chain class
    - [Iterator](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level2.html) - metadata level 2 Iterator class

The package includes [typings](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/blob/dev/lib/index.d.ts) that could help you :)

All memory is managed by the library. But there are some methods that give you references to objects that can be destroyed before the JS object. These methods are documented with such special behaviour.

Almost every function/method expects his parameters in his right type (as in the FLAC documentation). If it not, an JS exception will be thrown, or in the worst scenario, a crash (_report an issue if this happens_). So, pay attention on the types of the functions (the typings are just to help you ðŸ˜€).

Callbacks don't follow exactly the same signature that shows in Encoder and Decoder sections (from the FLAC documentation). They don't need some of the parameters as in JS there are other ways to get the encoder/decoder instance and some context. The init functions don't receive any private data.

There are asynchronous functions and methods for IO bound tasks. The syncrhonous API will be faster, but will block node. If you are writing an server or expect high concurrency, use the asynchronous API.

You need node version that supports v6 or v7 N-API ([see compatibility table](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api_version_matrix)), but it is recommended to use v10.20.0/v12.17.0/v14.12.0 or higher. Recommended use of `BigInt` when possible to have numbers be represented without truncation (`Number` can only store 53 bit integers! ðŸ¤¨).

> **Note**: starting from Node 14.x, `Buffer` had a rewrite that tracks pointers across the whole JS env. In order to share pointers from flac to node, the native code cleans up the trackings time to time when required. But this also means that buffers from `Encoder`, `Decoder` and `IO Callbacks` (metadata level 2) has a strict lifetime: buffers are ensured to be valid inside the callback itself, if the buffer must be used outside the callback make a copy. (also affects 12.19.0 or higher even though the mentioned rewrite did not happen)

## How to install

```
$ npm install flac-bindings

$ yarn add flac-bindings
```

The library has some native code that binds the JS code to the flac library. Depending on your platform, it can be an already-compiled library that will not require anything from you, or require to compile iself. The following logic applies:

- If your CPU is `amd64`/`x86_64` and the OS is `Linux/glibc`, `Linux/musl`, `macOS` or `Windows`, and node version is in the [N-API compatibility table](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v12.x/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api_version_matrix) for v4 or v6, then the prebuild version will download.
- If you have `pkg-config` and `libFLAC` development package installed (`apt install libflac-dev`, `pacman -S flac`, `apk add flac-dev`, `brew install flac`...), then it will use this library and only compile the binding code. Requires you to have [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) installed.
- In any other case, it will download `libogg` and `libFLAC` source code and compile both libraries plus the binding code. Requires you to have [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) and `git` installed.

See [How to compile](#how-to-compile) section for more information.

For use it, include with

```javascript
const flac = require('flac-bindings');  // default node import
import flac from 'flac-bindings';       // ES6 import
import * as flac from 'flac-bindings';  // TypeScript import
```

> **Note**: _this library has its own TypeScript typings, so it's possible to use it in a TS project and have the right types_

## Examples

Here's an example of using `flac-bindings` to encode some raw PCM data coming from `process.stdin` to a FLAC file that gets piped to `process.stdout`:

```js
const { StreamEncoder } = require('flac-bindings');

// create the Encoder instance
const encoder = new StreamEncoder({
  channels: 2,        // 2 channels (left and right)
  bitsPerSample: 16,  // 16-bit samples
  samplerate: 44100,  // 44,100 Hz sample rate

  compressionLevel: 7,
});

// raw PCM data from stdin gets piped into the encoder
process.stdin.pipe(encoder);

// the generated FLAC file gets piped to stdout
encoder.pipe(process.stdout);
```

See the [tests](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/tree/dev/test/) directory for more examples using advanced API.

## Debug the library

When using `StreamEncoder`, `StreamDecoder`, `FileEncoder` or `FileDecoder`, and something does not work properly, you can enable verbose/debug logs by defining the environment variable `DEBUG=flac:*` (see [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) package for more information). Each class has its own namespace, so you can enable debug logs only for some of them. See below the list of namespaces:

- `StreamEncoder`: `flac:encoder:stream`
- `FileEncoder`: `flac:encoder:file`
- `StreamDecoder`: `flac:decoder:stream`
- `FileDecoder`: `flac:decoder:file`

> !! These logs can be useful when creating a new issue.

## How to compile

To compile the bindings you need [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) installed in your system and accessible from the terminal, and the C and C++ compilers as well. On Windows, the compilers can be installed easily with `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`. Don't forget `git`. It is mandatory!

There are some options to use when compiling. If you have a FLAC dev package already installed (`apt install libflac-dev`, `pacman -S flac`, `apk add flac-dev`, `brew install flac`...) and you want to compile the bindings to use this library instead, define the environment variable `FLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` (this will be the default option if no prebuild version is available, but a dev package is available).

Then, you just need to recompile the package with: `npm rebuild flac-bindings`. If you are inside this repo tree, then run `npm run install`.

For more advanced commands for compilation inside the repo tree, see below:

```sh
# Compile (debug version)
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug

# Compile with sanitizers (only available on Linux and macOS)
npm run cmake-js -- configure --CDSANITIZE=ON --debug
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug

# Compile with external FLAC library (can be combined with sanitizers)
npm run cmake-js -- configure --CDFLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY=ON --debug
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug

# Clean compilation folder
npm run cmake-js -- clean
```

## How to run the tests

With a dev environment, and being able to compile the project, ensure to have installed the `flac` CLI (`apt install flac`, `pacman -S flac`, `apk add flac`, `brew install flac`...) and present in the `$PATH`. It is recommended to have installed the FLAC dev package and to have configured the project with `--CDFLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY=ON`. Also ensure to have installed [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) and available in the `$PATH`.

The recommended steps are:

```sh
# Do not run tests with sanitizers enabled, it's tricker to make it work
npm run cmake-js -- configure --CDFLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY=ON --debug
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug
npm test

# To run tests with coverage (requires lcov to be installed)
scripts/coverage.sh rebuild # first time
script/coverage.sh          # next times
```

Happy `npm test` runs :)
