## What can this binding do for me?

You can use all the functions from encoder and decoder modules inside Javascript with struct-to-js (and viceversa) conversions. The FLAC library will load dynamically on runtime or with some help, you can tell where the library is. Also, any chunk of data that the FLAC API needs is solved by a simple node Buffer. And it has some beautiful js classes for encoder and decoder too.

See the [FLAC API](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac.html)? You can use it with a very intuitive form: almost equal.

## How it works?

First, tries to open the library with the usual paths in the system. If it fails, the module will provide you a `load` function, pass to it a **full** path to the library and it will load. The module will be divided in various sections:

 - [format](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__format.html) - includes only the functions and some types
 - [Encoder](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__encoder.html)
 - [Decoder](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__decoder.html)
 - [metadata](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__object.html) - includes the `StreamMetadata` structs and their methods.
 - [metadata0](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level0.html)
 - [SimpleIterator](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level1.html)
 - [Chain](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level2.html)
 - [Iterator](https://xiph.org/flac/api/group__flac__metadata__level2.html)

The package includes [typings](https://github.com/melchor629/node-flac-bindings/blob/master/lib/index.d.ts) that could help you :)

The Encoder, Decoder, the metadata level 1 `SimpleIterator`, the metadata level 2 `Chain` and `Iterator` and `StreamMetadata` structs are classes that can be instantiated like usual JS classes. The constructor will create the underlying pointer to the object un the C API, and when the GC cleans up the objects, the pointer will be free'd as well.

## Things to take into account

Almost every function/method expects his parameters in his right type. If it not, node will crash or an JS exception will be thrown. So, pay attention on the types of the functions (the typings are just to help you ðŸ˜€).

Callbacks don't follow exactly the signature that shows in Encoder and Decoder sections, they don't need some of the parameters as in JS there are other ways to get the encoder/decoder instance and some context. The init functions don't receive any private data.

You need node 10 or higher. Recommended use of `BigInt` when possible to have numbers be represented without truncation (`Number` can only store 53 bit integers! ðŸ¤¨).

## How to install

```
$ npm install flac-bindings

$ yarn add flac-bindings
```

The library has some native code that binds the JS code to the flac library. Depending on your platform, it can be an already-compiled library that will not require anything from you, or require to compile iself. The following logic applies:

- If your CPU is `amd64`/`x86_64` and the OS is `Linux/glibc`, `Linux/musl`, `macOS` or `Windows`, then the prebuild version will download.
- If you have `pkg-config` and `libFLAC` development package installed (`apt install libflac-dev`, `pacman -S flac`, `apk add flac-dev`, `brew install flac`...), then it will use this library and only compile the binding code. Requires you to have [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) installed.
- In any other case, it will download `libogg` and `libFLAC` source code and compile both libraries plus the binding code. Requires you to have [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) and `git` installed.

See [How to compile][#how-to-compile] section for more information.

> It is recommended to have installed [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) and `git` on the system when installing the packages so if a prebuild package is not avaiable, the installation will continue without any problems

For use it, include with

```javascript
const flac = require('flac-bindings');  // default node import
import flac from 'flac-bindings';       // ES6 import
import * as flac from 'flac-bindings';  // TypeScript import
```

`flac` will be an object with `{ api: [Bindings API], StreamEncoder: ..., StreamDecoder: ..., FileEncoder: ..., FileDecoder: ... }`.

## How to compile

To compile the bindings you need [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) installed in your system and accessible from the terminal, and the C and C++ compilers as well. On Windows, the compilers can be installed easily with `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools`. Don't forget `git`. It is mandatory!

There are some options to use when compiling. If you have a FLAC dev package already installed (`apt install libflac-dev`, `pacman -S flac`, `apk add flac-dev`, `brew install flac`...) and you want to compile the bindings to use this library instead, define the environment variable `FLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY` (this will be the default option if no prebuild version is available, but a dev package is available).

Then, you just need to recompile the package with: `npm rebuild flac-bindings`. If you are inside this repo tree, then run `npm run install`.

For more advanced commands for compilation inside the repo tree, see below:

```sh
# Compile (debug version)
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug

# Compile with sanitizers (only available on Linux and macOS)
npm run cmake-js -- configure --CDSANITIZE=ON --debug
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug

# Compile with external FLAC library (can be combined with sanitizers)
npm run cmake-js -- configure --CDFLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY=ON --debug
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug

# Clean compilation folder
npm run cmake-js -- clean
```

## How to run the tests

With a dev environment, and being able to compile the project, ensure to have installed the `flac` CLI (`apt install flac`, `pacman -S flac`, `apk add flac`, `brew install flac`...) and present in the `$PATH`. It is recommended to have installed the FLAC dev package and to have configured the project with `--CDFLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY=ON`. Also ensure to have installed [Cmake](https://www.cmake.org) and available in the `$PATH`.

The recommended steps are:

```sh
# Do not run tests with sanitizers enabled, it's tricker to make it work
npm run cmake-js -- configure --CDFLAC_BINDINGS_USE_EXTERNAL_LIBRARY=ON --debug
npm run cmake-js -- build --debug
npm test

# To run tests with coverage (requires lcov to be installed)
scripts/coverage.sh rebuild # first time
script/coverage.sh          # next times
```

Happy `npm test` runs :)
